 Innovation & Investment
 

This project is my customized and fully documented version of the Vanguard assignment for GIT 337. It began as a fork of the instructor’s original repository and was expanded, refined, and restructured by me to meet course requirements and demonstrate responsive design, clean HTML/CSS architecture, and professional documentation practices.
