# 📊 Vanguard — GIT 337  
**Author:** Elizabeth Johnson  

Vanguard is my customized, mobile-first, fully documented version of the instructor’s starter project for GIT 337.  
This project began as a fork of the instructor’s repository and was expanded, cleaned, and restructured by me to demonstrate responsive design, accessible HTML/CSS, and professional documentation practices.
