# PROVENANCE.md  
**Author:** Elizabeth Johnson  
**Course:** GIT 337  
**Project:** Vanguard  

## Purpose
This document explains which parts of the Vanguard project were inherited from the instructor’s original repository and which parts were created or modified by me. This ensures full academic integrity and transparency regarding authorship.

## Fork Attribution
This project is a fork of the instructor’s original repository:  
https://github.com/ccarra1/vanguard  
Licensed under GPL-3.0 (included in this repository).

## What I Inherited from the Instructor
The following files and structures were already present in the original repository based on instructor commits from **March 11** and **October 9** (ccarra1):

- Base HTML scaffold and initial structure  
- Starter CSS file and layout rules  
- Initial written text and headings  
- All original image assets in the `/images` directory  
- General class naming patterns and foundational design system  
- Early responsive layout framework  
- Instructor commits from Oct 9 and Mar 11 (not authored by me)

These components formed the starting point for my work.
