## Purpose
This document explains which parts of the project were inherited from the instructor’s original repository and which parts were created or modified by me. This ensures full academic integrity and clarity.

## What I Inherited from the Instructor
The following elements were already present in the original repository from instructor commits dated March 11 and October 9:

- Starter text content and section headings  
- Original image assets in the /images folder
